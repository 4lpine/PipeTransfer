# PipeTransfer
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The PipeTransfer tool is a command-line tool designed for seamless file transfer between systems using `ppng.io`. It supports three distinct modes: "send," "receive," and "infect,".

# Commands 
> **Send** : The send is pretty straighforward, it's used to send a file/folder with the command : <br>
> `pipetransfer send (file/folder) (key)`
>
> **Receive** : The receive command is used to receive folders with the command : <br>
> `pipetransfer receive (key)`
>
> **Infect** : This command was made specifically for malware enthusiasts, simply use the command : <br>
> `pipetransfer infect (yourexe.exe) (key)` and pipetransfer will create a windows command for your file which can be used on any windows machine to download and run your exe.

# Installation
To install PipeTransfer simply run the command : <br>
`curl -o temp.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4lpine/PipeTransfer/main/base64source(ignore%20this).txt && certutil -decode temp.txt pipetransfer.exe && del temp.txt && move pipetransfer.exe C:\PipeTransfer\ && setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\PipeTransfer"` <br>
**Make sure to restart command prompt when you're done :)**

> [!NOTE]
> - key and link are the same thing, i.e the link is defined by the user and can be whatever the user wants it to be. <- (to avoid confusion)
> 
> - Removal of the tool is also simple as all you have to do is delete the PipeTransfer folder in C:/
